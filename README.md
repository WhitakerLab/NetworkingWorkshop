# Networking Workshop

Notes and resources for workshop: *Networking for success - mentorship, sponsorship and international connectivity in the digital age*.

This workshop was developed by Kirstie Whitaker for International Max Planck Research School for Translational Psychiatry (IMPRS-TP) graduate student retreat in May 2019.

## Abstract

Dr Kirstie Whitaker will lead an interactive discussion on networking for early career researchers.
The word "networking" fills most of us with dread.
It conjures images of awkward introductions and uncomfortable self promotion.
Alternatively, networking can be seen as an opportunity to share your skills and expertise with others.
It is one of the most effective ways of making a positive influence on the world.
Similarly, mentorship and sponsorship are often conflated.
Mentors are your support network, while your sponsors are the people who promote you when you are not in the room.
(They are networking on your behalf!)
During this two hour session we will work in small groups to discuss the benefits and challenges of networking using digital tools (social media, blog posts, community connections and 1:1 contacts) for early career researchers.
Please come with a question that you don't know how to answer, and with a few thoughts about what you'd like to achive in the next step of your career.

## Agenda

This workshop is designed to be 2 hours long.
It can very easily be adapted to being longer or shorter.
Pull requests to suggest alternative timelines are very welcome.

## Detailed description

### Welcome, introduction, code of conduct & motivation

*10 minutes*

For this part of the workshop the facilitator gives a brief overview of the next few hours.

* Who I am.
* Why I'm here.
* Why I care.
* Incentive structures in academia.
* 

### Post it session: Definitions and pain points

*10 minutes*

All participants are asked to write down on separate post it notes a **defintion** and a **difficulty** that they have for the following topics:

* Networking
* Mentorship
* Sponsortship
* Digital connectivity

The best way to do this exercise is to have four zones already set up in the room, one for each of the different topics.

Participants are asked to move the post it notes around and collect them together as they add their notes.

### Feedback and reflection: Definitions and pain points

*5 minutes*

This feedback and reflection session allows all workshop participants and the facilitator to summarise the different topics and to identify key challenges that are shared across multiple participants.

A workshop participant should be asked to summarise and report out the key points from each of the four topics identified above.
(A separate participant for each topic.)

### Demonstration: Personas exercise

*5 minutes*

The facilitator briefly outlines the personas exercise and briefly works through a set example.
The choice of this example should be tailored to the group.

### Personas & pathways exercise

*10 minutes*

Participants are assigned into groups of 4 or 5.

Each group is asked to discuss an example future goal.
They can choose a persona from the list below, or they can create their own persona.

Suggested personas are:

* A 1st year graduate student who wants to go to a lab for 3 months to learn a new skill.
* A final year graduate student who wants to get a postdoc position in a new research area.
* A 2nd year graduate student who wants to get a job as a patent attourny for a pharmacutical company.
* A 3rd year graduate student who wants to get a 6 month internship at Deep Mind.
* A final year graduate student who wants to get a job in government policy making (eg UK civil service, US congress etc).

The group are asked to reflect on:

* The student's goals.
* The pathway they should take to achieve those goals.
* An appropriate timeline.
* Who are the key people who should also be identified and consulted? Their goals and motivations.
* A best case scenario.
* Key failure points and actions that can make the pathway more resilient.

If materials are available, each group could make an A1 sized poster about their person to make it easier to report back.

### Feedback: Personas exercise

*15 minutes*

Each group has 2 minutes to report back to the whole group of workshop participants about their recommended persona and associated pathway.

Note that this section of the workshop has the potential to take quite a long time.
It is up to the facilitator whether they want to be strict on timings or let it roll into the second half of the workshop.

### Short break & reflection

*10 minutes*

These workshops can be very intense and personal so this 10 minute break allows people to rest and reflect on the first half of the session.
Participants can go to the bathroom if they'd like, or check their email.
